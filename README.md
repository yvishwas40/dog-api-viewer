# 🐶 Dog API Viewer

This is a simple web app that shows random dog images using the [Dog CEO API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/).  
You can refresh the images or search for specific dog breeds like "golden retriever" or "beagle".

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The app shows 5 random dog images when it loads.
2. You can enter a breed name (like "labrador" or "golden retriever") in the input box and press **Enter** or click **Refresh**.
3. It will then show 5 images of that breed.
4. If no breed is entered, it will just refresh with random dogs.
